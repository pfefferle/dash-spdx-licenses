            Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
               this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will
               be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
               intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and

               You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may Deploy Covered Code, provided that You must in each instance:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; make all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available in Source Code form via electronic distribution (e.g. download from a web site) under the terms of this License and subject to the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, and any additional terms You may choose to offer under Section 6. You must continue to make the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications available for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; must notify Apple and other third parties of how to obtain Your Deployed Modifications by filling out and submitting the required information found at http://www.apple.com/publicsource/modifications.html; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; if you Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patents and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patents and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, execute, compile, display, perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through multiple tiers of distribution.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple by reason of any such Additional Terms.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Original Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Original Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Original Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9, APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Original Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Original Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Liability.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Infringement. If any of the Original Code becomes the subject ofa claim of infringement ("Affected Original Code"), Apple may, at its sole discretion and option: (a) attempt to procure the rights necessary for You to continue using the Affected Original Code; (b) modify the Affected Original Code so that it is no longer infringing; or (c) terminate Your rights to use the Affected Original Code, effective immediately upon Apple's posting of a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac OS X", "Mac OS X Server" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code

   other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple's development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Sections 9.1 and/or 13.6(b); or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification and distribution of the Covered Code, or Affected Original Code in the case of termination under Section 9.1, and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code or Affected Original Code (in the case of

      termination under Section 9.1) that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Export Law Assurances. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Original Code except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Code was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Original Code may not be exported or re-exported (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders. By using the Original Code, You represent and warrant that You are not located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in

      accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.8";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.
