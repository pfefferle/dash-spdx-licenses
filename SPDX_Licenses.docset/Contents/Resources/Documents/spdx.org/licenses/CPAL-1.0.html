          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This license is essentially a rebranded version of MPL-1.1, but with some important changes. The added §14 includes an advertising clause, and in order for that CPAL-1.0 introduces the concept of an "Original Developer" ("organizer of the development of the Original Code"). The added §15 extends the (weak) copyleft also to trigger on network use.</p>

                     this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
                     impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
                     version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may

              Description of Modifications.
                <br/>

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
                     changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
                     include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
                     indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
                     name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
                     ownership of the Covered Code.

                  Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
                     intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                     Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                     Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
                     party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
                     Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described
                     in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
                     makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                     mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                     Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

                     Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
                     possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                     then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a
                     user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                     Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
                     Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
                     Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
                     Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
                     You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
                     any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity

              Distribution of Executable Versions.
                <br/>

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                     3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
                     the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                     License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
                     of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
                     Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
                     recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
                     Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
                     which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
                     version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source
                     Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
                     Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
                     any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
                     Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                     Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
                     by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
                     terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                     case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You
                 must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
                 (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
                 distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
                 regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary

                     such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
                     by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
                     apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must
                     (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Socialtext",
                     "CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
                     (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
                     clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL.

              As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code
                 ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may help
                 justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original
                 Developer may include in Exhibit B ("Attribution Information") a requirement
                 that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run
                 (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original
                 Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic
                 user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include
                 display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent
                 with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the
                 end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for
                 access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays
                 such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen,
                 notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated attribution area on user
                 interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way
                 of meeting this requirement for notice.

              Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image
                 and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to the Attribution
                 Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient
                 duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer
                 and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties,
                 You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no
                 less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other
                 party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B
                 below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code
                 resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is
                 to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot
                 require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution
                 Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a
                 word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the
                 Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution
                 Limits").

                 You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution Obligations.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions.

      Socialtext, Inc. ("Socialtext") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Socialtext", "CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="14.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B ("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution Limits").

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="15.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.

   The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; EXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.

"The contents of this file are subject to the Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
