      Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preamble
    </p>

    <p>
      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep
      users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
      all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free
      Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to
      make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
      of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </p>

    <p>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
      can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    </p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">0.</var>
        This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and
        a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
          or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">1.</var>
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence
        of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
        copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You
          may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">2.</var>
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
          of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">a)</var>
            cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
          </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">b)</var>
            cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,
            either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this General
            Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty
            protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
          </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">c)</var>
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to
            print or display an announcement including an appropriate
            copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
            redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
            the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.
          </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">d)</var>
            You may charge a fee for the physical act of
            transferring a copy, and you may at your option
            offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          </li>
</ul>
        <p>
          Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or
          its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
          does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.
        </p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">3.</var>
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion
        or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
        or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and
          2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">a)</var>
            accompany it with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
            under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">b)</var>
            accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
            three years, to give any third party free (except for a
            nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
          </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">c)</var>
            accompany it with the information you received as to where the
            corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
          </li>
</ul>
        <p>
          Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
          but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
          modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
          system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
          files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.
        </p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">4.</var>
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
        Program except as expressly provided under this General Public
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from
        you under this General Public License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">5.</var>
        By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
        work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of
          this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">6.</var>
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
          restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">7.</var>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
          but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of the license which applies
          to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        </p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">8.</var>
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
          software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p>
          NO WARRANTY
        </p>

        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">9.</var>
          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
          WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
          PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
          THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
          ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        </p>

      </li>
<li>
        <p><var class="replacable-license-text">10.</var>
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      </p>

      <p>
        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      </p>

      <p>
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      </p>

      <p>
        &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea
        of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;
      </p>

      <p>
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it
        and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
        either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.
      </p>

      <p>
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      </p>

      <p>
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
        type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to
        redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
        you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
        could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="0.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.
