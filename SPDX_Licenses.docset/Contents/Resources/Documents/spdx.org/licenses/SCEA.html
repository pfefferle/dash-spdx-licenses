   In exchange for the rights that are granted to You free of charge under this License, You
                 agree that You will not file for any patent application, seek copyright protection or
                 take any other action that might otherwise impair the ownership rights in and to the
                 Software that may belong to SCEA or any of the other contributors/authors of the

             "Contributions"). Per the terms of this License You are free to modify the Software and those
             modifications would belong to You. You may however wish to donate Your Contributions to SCEA
             for consideration for inclusion into the Software. For the avoidance of doubt, if You elect to
             send Your Contributions to SCEA, You are doing so voluntarily and are giving the Contributions
             to SCEA and its parent company Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc., free of charge, to use,
             modify or distribute in any form or in any manner. SCEA acknowledges that if You make a
             donation of Your Contributions to SCEA, such Contributions shall not exclusively belong to
             SCEA or its parent company and such donation shall not be to Your exclusion. SCEA, in its sole
             discretion, shall determine whether or not to include Your donated Contributions into the
             Software, in whole, in part, or as modified by SCEA. Should SCEA elect to include any such
             Contributions into the Software, it shall do so at its own risk and may elect to give credit
             or special thanks to any such contributors in the attached copyright notice. However, if any
             of Your contributions are included into the Software, they will become part of the Software
             and will be distributed under the terms and conditions of this License. Further, if Your
             donated Contributions are integrated into the Software then Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.
             shall become the copyright owner of the Software now containing Your contributions and SCEA
             would be the Licensor.</p>
