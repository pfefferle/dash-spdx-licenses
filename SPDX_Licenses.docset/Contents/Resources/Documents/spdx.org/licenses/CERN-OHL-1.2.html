            <p>
Preamble</p>

            <p>
Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence ("CERN OHL") version 1.2, CERN wishes to provide a tool to foster collaboration and sharing among hardware designers. The CERN OHL is copyright CERN. Anyone is welcome to use the CERN OHL, in unmodified form only, for the distribution of their own Open Hardware designs. Any other right is reserved. Release of hardware designs under the CERN OHL does not constitute an endorsement of the licensor or its designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in the development of such designs.</p>

            <p>
1. Definitions</p>

            <p>
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>

            <p>
"Licence" means this CERN OHL.</p>

            <p>
"Documentation" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any other media.</p>

            <p>
"Documentation Location" means a location where the Licensor has placed Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly accessible for at least three years from the first communication to the public or distribution of Documentation.</p>

            <p>
"Product" means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Documentation or the modified Documentation.</p>

            <p>
"Licensee" means any natural or legal person exercising rights under this Licence.</p>

            <p>
"Licensor" means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or distributes the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence.</p>

            <p>
A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa.</p>

            <p>
Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders and is employed solely to facilitate reading.</p>

            <p></p>
