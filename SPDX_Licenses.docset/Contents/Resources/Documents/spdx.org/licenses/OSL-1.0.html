             Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to
             access and modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy

             LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF

             YOU.

          Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between
             Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original
             Work, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written
             agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
             equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any
             of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this
             License and all of its terms and conditions. This license shall terminate immediately and you
             may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to
             honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

          Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no
             longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any
             court alleging that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license
             containing this "Mutual Termination for Patent Action" clause infringes any patent
             claims that are essential to use that software.

<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">10)</var>
          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit arising under or relating to
             this License shall be maintained in the courts of the jurisdiction wherein the Licensor
             resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
             jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
             Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of
             the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject
             to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq., the
             equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the
             termination of this License.

             thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
             without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such
             action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of

          Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
             hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
             reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

          Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
