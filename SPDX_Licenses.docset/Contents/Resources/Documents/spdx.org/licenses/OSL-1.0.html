          Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between

             Work, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written

             of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this
             License and all of its terms and conditions. This license shall terminate immediately and you

             court alleging that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license
             containing this "Mutual Termination for Patent Action" clause infringes any patent
             claims that are essential to use that software.

          Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit arising under or relating to
             this License shall be maintained in the courts of the jurisdiction wherein the Licensor
             resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
             jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
             Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of
             the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject
             to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the
             equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the

          Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
