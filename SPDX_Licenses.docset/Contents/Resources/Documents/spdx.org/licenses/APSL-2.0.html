<li>
                        <var class="replacable-license-text">(c)</var>

                     License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you
                     Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial
                     External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source
                     Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a
                     web site).

               </li>
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">2.3</var>
              Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code
                 (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must
                 include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
                 stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License
                 with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.
            </li>
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text">2.4</var>
              Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each
                 Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth
                 herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does
                 not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple
                 and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity
                 based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
                 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
                 responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
                 example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the
                 Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
                 Covered Code.

</ul>
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">3.</var>
          Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this
             License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under
             this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your
             Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
             controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
             Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses
             under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">4.</var>
          Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such
             instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
             Code or any portion thereof.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">5.</var>
          Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights,
             express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require
             additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">6.</var>
          Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
             or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted
             herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
             may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple
             or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional
             Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and
             every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or
             such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.
        </li>
<li>
            <var class="replacable-license-text">7.</var>
          Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
             to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Inc.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Externally Deploy" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication with a client other than You.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Permitted Uses; Conditions &amp; Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Miscellaneous.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.

      Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigÃ© que le prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.
